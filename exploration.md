# First Impressions

### Cover.js
- Declares a new class "Cover" with 5 properties, 4 of which are going to be passed in as arguments somewhere - The image call, the title, and both descriptor adjectives. One of the properties is storing the date of creation, which doesn't seem to appear anywhere. Could be used in arraging the created covers in order of creation.
