# First Impressions

### Cover.js
- Declares a new class "Cover" with 5 properties, 4 of which are going to be passed in as arguments somewhere - The image call, the title, and both descriptor adjectives. One of the properties is storing the date of creation, which doesn't seem to appear anywhere. Could be used in arraging the created covers in order of creation.

### Data.js
- Declares our variables holding our cover images, title names, and descriptor words. These will hold all inputted data and be referred to when making random covers. 
- In theory could also be used for drop down menus on our input fields if users couldn't think of something themself maybe?
