## Learning Goals:
---
- Learn how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are all connected. 
- Learn how to build an application with the user in mind.
- Learn how to coordinate and code between two different people.

## Wins + Challenges:
---
- Our main win would be figuring out how to take our objects in our Saved Covers array and give them html elements so they can be displayed, as well as using those elements to manipulate them on user events.
- A big challenge was figuring out how to not only delete them from the screen, but also from the saved covers array so they wouldn't show back up once deleted.
